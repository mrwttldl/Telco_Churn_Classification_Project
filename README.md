# :calling: Telco_Churn_Classification_Project

Simply, customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service. Also known as customer attrition, customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain  existing customers than it is to acquire new customers – earning business from new customers means working leads all the way through the sales funnel, utilizing your marketing and sales resources throughout the process. 
Customer retention, on the other hand, is generally more cost-effective as you’ve already earned the trust and loyalty of existing customers.

I applied classification algorithms to the Telco Churn dataset where I did exploratory data analysis.

The telco.csv file in this folder is the latest version of the dataset where I do my EDA studies on the dataset I downloaded from kaggle.
